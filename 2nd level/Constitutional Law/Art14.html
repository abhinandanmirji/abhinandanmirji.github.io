            <div class="subtitle" id="Introduction"> Introduction</div>
            Equality is a basic human need which protects the dignity of a man. All human beings are born equal; hence they must be treated equally. This notion of equality has been incorporated under article 14 to article 18 of Indian Constitution.</p>
            Article 14 gives equality in relation with laws, while Article 15 speaks about prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth; Article 16 speaks about Equality of opportunity in public employment; 17, about abolition of untouchability and 18 abolishing the titles.
            The main feature of article 14 is, it gives possibilities for reasonable classification.</p>
            Equality before law - The state shall not deny any person equality before the law or the equal protection of laws within the territory of India.</p>
            This phrase can be divided into two parts:
            <div class="subtitle2" id="section2"> i)  Equality before law.</div>
            The first half Equality before law is an English common law concept. Best depiction of this can be found in the statue of lady justice. Lady justice has blindfolded her eyes; hence all are equal before the law. Rich - poor; Male - Female; Upper caste - Lower caste, all are equal in the eyes of justice. Prof. A.V Dicey had said, “With us every official, from the Prime Minister down to a constable or a collector of taxes, is under same responsibility for every act done without any legal justification as any other citizen"[1]. In his book Law of Constitution, he gives 3 meanings for Rule of law:</p>
            1.Equality before law and absence of arbitrariness and discretion.<br>
            2.Supremacy of law.<br>
            3.Law is the guardian of rights and liberties of citizens.<br>
            <div class="subtitle2" id="section3">ii) Equal Protection of law.</div>
            The second half is an American concept. Equal protection of law can be seen in 14th Amendment to the US constitution. Dicey’s third meaning of rule of law mentions about law protecting the rights and liberties of people, this can be seen in second half of the article 14. Law protects everyone's rights and liberties without any discrimination.
            <div class="subtitle" id="section4">Principle of Equality as mentioned under article 14</div>
            Equality under article 14 does not mean negative meaning of equality, where everyone is treated equally, despite their reasonable differences. It means that, similar must be treated similarly while different may be treated differently. This allows for positive meaning of the equality to be adopted. Although all students are equal in teacher's eyes, they still cannot teach the same syllabus to the students of different grade. If they do so, then it will be unequal treatment as lower grade students may not understand the subject matter of higher age group. With the same idea in mind, our constitution makers have added some provisions under article 15, which speaks about the power of parliament to make such special laws which gives positive discrimination. Hence, we can say the Indian constitution talks for equality while allowing reasonable classification. State while making the law can make classification between people but it must be reasonable. For that law to be termed as reasonable, it must pass the Test of reasonable classification.  
			<div class="subtitle" id="section5">The Test of Reasonable/ Valid Classification</div>
            This test was given in Anwar Ali Sarkar v. State of West Bengal (1952) [2]. In involves 2 parts:</p>
            1)The classification must base on an intelligible differentia.<br>
            2)The Differentia should have a rational nexus with the object sought to be achieved by the statute.</p>
            This means, that the difference or classification made, must be able to understand for a rational man and that classification must be based on or in accordance with reason or logic of the Act in question. With this test the Calcutta High Court held the West Bengal Special Courts act (1950), which gave state the power to regard some cases as special and try them under special court as unreasonable classification.</p> Under Indian Contract act 1872, section 11: It classifies adult and minor and allows only adult to enter into contract.
            Here we can see,<br>
            Object: Capacity enter into the contract.<br>
            Classification: Adult and Minor.<br>
            Hence, we can call it reasonable as minor may not have that mental capacity to enter into a contract.</p>
            In DP Joshi v. State of Madhya Bharat [3], classification was between residents and non-residents, where residents did not have to pay some fee while non-residents had to. This was held valid, but if that classification was based on place of birth, it would be invalid.</p>
            In Ramakrishna Dalmia v. Justice SR Tendulkar [4], the petitioner was a businessman and it was claimed that he and his family is using the Dalmia Bharat Group's money which is the reason for company’s loss. Government through official gazette formed an enquiry committee headed by Justice Tendulkar. RK Dalmia claimed that this action of government is violating his right to equality. But court held the classification to be valid.
            <div class="subtitle" id="section6">New Test</div> 
            Justice Bhagwati, Justice Chandrachud and Justice Krishna Iyer, gave a new concept for the existing test in E.P. Royappa v. State of Tamil Nādu [5].  Bhagwati J also repeated this in Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India [6]. The new test talks about arbitrariness, Bhagwati J had said, "Article 14 strikes at arbitrariness in State action and ensures fairness and equality of treatment."
            <div class="subtitle" id="section7">Conclusion</div> 
            The new test gives the people protection from arbitrary action. It allows state to make positive classification between people to treat them equally. Sometimes it is every important to classify the people to keep equality between them. But this power of the state must not be used arbitrarily.
