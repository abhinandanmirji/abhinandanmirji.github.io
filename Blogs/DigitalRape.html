            <div class="subtitle" id="Introduction"> Introduction</div>
            Digital rape does not refer to the sexual offence commited online or anyother activity online. There is a common understanding of people that it refers to cyber crime or sexual activity commited online. If any person insertes finger, thumb and toe into another person's body, the act is called Digital Rape.</p>
            This was not an offence, until 2012 December it came under the ambit of molestation. It was considered as rape only after Nirbhaya Rape, after which the parliament made an amendment which called it a rape.
            <div class="subtitle" id="section2"> To whom it doesn't apply?</div>
            It applies to bothe minor and major. The digital rape in India was rapidly increasing hence, the punishment for it has been rigorous.<br>
            In India, the scope of it was not widned but it is now considered as an offence under section 375 of IPC and some other provisions of IPC. It is also considered as an offence under Section 3 and few more sections under POSCO act.<br>
            <div class="subtitle2" id="section3">Punishment for Digital Rape</div>
            Usually under POSCO act it is for 5 years but under IPC it varies from 10 years to life imprisionment.
            <div class="subtitle2" id="section4">Proper meaning of Diglital Rape</div>
            A person inserting any of his fingers, toe or object into a women's vagina, urethra, mouth or anus without  her consent is called as digital rape.
