 	There lived a handsome man in the depths of the forest. All the animals said he was smart and wise. <br> 
			He used to sing a song, it was:<br>
			what is the cost of happinesss you speak of?<br>
			it is the only thing I dream of.<br>
			Kings on the throne,<br>
			old lying prone,<br>
			only want that thing,<br>
			it is for what I sing.
